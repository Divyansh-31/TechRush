         <h1>Clefs</h1>
    <p>A <strong>clef</strong> is a symbol at the beginning of the staff that specifies the pitch of the notes on the staff. Different clefs are used, each with its own note as a starting point, so you can write low and high notes using the fewest possible ledger lines, making the notes easier to read.</p>

       <h2>1. Treble clef</h2>
    <p>The treble clef (also called the G clef) indicates that the note G above middle C falls on the second line of the staff. The treble clef curls around the line where G falls.</p>
    <p>The treble clef is useful for writing notes above middle C and is used in songbooks and for high-pitched instruments such as guitar, violin, flute, clarinet, saxophone, and trumpet.</p>

       <h2>2. Bass clef</h2>
          <p>The bass clef (also called the F clef) indicates that the note F below middle C falls on the fourth line of the staff. The bass clef's two dots surround the line where F falls.</p>
    <p>The bass clef is useful for writing notes below middle C and is used for low-pitched instruments such as bass guitar, double bass, cello, bassoon, trombone, and tuba.</p>

      <h2>3. Grand staff</h2>
         <p>The grand staff combines two staves: the treble clef in the upper staff and the bass clef in the lower staff. They are connected by a vertical line and a brace on the left side.</p>
    <p>Middle C falls between the two staves, on the first ledger line below the treble staff or the first ledger line above the bass staff. The grand staff is used for instruments such as piano, organ, marimba, and harp.</p>

    <h2>4. Alto clef</h2>
    <p>The alto clef is a C clef where middle C falls on the third line of the staff. It is primarily used for the viola, though treble or bass clefs are often substituted in some music.</p>

    <h2>5. Tenor clef</h2>
        <p>The tenor clef is a C clef where middle C falls on the fourth line of the staff. It is primarily used for cello, bassoon, and trombone, though treble or bass clefs are often substituted.</p>

    <h2>6. Octave clefs</h2>
    <p>Octave clefs are variations of treble and bass clefs that indicate notes are played at a different pitch. An <strong>8</strong> above means an octave higher; an <strong>8</strong> below means an octave lower. A <strong>15</strong> indicates two octaves higher or lower.</p>
    <p>They help avoid excessive ledger lines. In some cases, special notations such as <em>Ottava alta</em>, <em>Ottava bassa</em>, <em>Quindicesima alta</em>, and <em>Quindicesima bassa</em> are used to mark temporary pitch changes for a section of music.</p>

    <h2>7. Clef change</h2>
    <p>Usually, the same clef is used throughout a piece. If notes extend far outside the staff, the clef can be changed to reduce ledger lines. When a clef is changed at the start of a new line, it appears both at the start of the new staff and at the end of the previous one. Mid-staff clefs are smaller in size than starting clefs.</p>
