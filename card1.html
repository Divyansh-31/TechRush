  <h1>Piano Notes Overview</h1>
  <p>In classical and popular music, especially from the Western world, there are <strong>twelve different notes</strong>. Seven of these notes are called the <strong>natural notes</strong> and are represented by the white keys on the piano. The black keys represent the remaining five notes.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>1. Natural Notes</h2>
  <p>The natural notes are named after the first seven letters of the alphabet: <strong>A, B, C, D, E, F, and G</strong>. The names of the notes are always capitalized.</p>
  <p>The piano is a helpful aid because it provides a visual overview of the notes. The starting point is usually based on the note C.</p>
  <p>The black keys are arranged in alternating groups of two and three. The note C is always on the white key to the left of the group of two black keys. Each note appears in several places on the piano: the further right, the higher the pitch; the further left, the lower the pitch.</p>
  <p><em>Exercise:</em> Try identifying “Naturals 1” and “Naturals 2” on a piano diagram.</p>

  <h2>2. Middle C</h2>
  <p>The middlemost C on the piano is called <strong>Middle C</strong>. On a standard 88-key piano, Middle C is the fourth C from the left. It serves as a key reference point to identify the correct version of a note.</p>

  <h2>3. Octaves</h2>
  <p>A standard piano has seven to eight versions of each note. The distance from any note to the nearest higher or lower version of the same note is called an <strong>octave</strong>.</p>
  <p>Octaves are numbered from low to high, starting with C. The octave containing the lowest C is called octave 1 (C1), while the octave containing the highest C is octave 8 (C8). All notes from C up to the next C share the same number.</p>
