  <h1>The Staff</h1>
  <p>The <strong>staff</strong> (also called the <em>stave</em>) is a collection of five horizontal lines used for music notation. Notes can be written on the lines and in between the spaces. The plural form of both <em>staff</em> and <em>stave</em> is <em>staves</em>.</p>

  <h2>1. Staff Positions</h2>
  <p>The staff consists of five horizontal lines and four spaces.</p>
  <p>Notes can be written on the lines and in between the spaces. When a note is written on a line, the line passes through the center of the note; when a note is written in a space, the note fills the entire space.</p>
  <p>Each note on the staff represents a natural note. The higher a note is located, the higher the pitch; the lower a note is located, the lower the pitch.</p>
  <p>Notes are read from left to right — notes on the left are played before notes on the right. Notes written above each other are played at the same time.</p>

  <h2>2. Ledger Lines</h2>
  <p>Notes can be written above and below the staff using <strong>ledger lines</strong>. Ledger lines are short lines that extend the staff when notes are too high or low to write on the staff itself.</p>
  <p>You can use as many ledger lines as needed. Notes located just above and below the staff are written without ledger lines.</p>

  <h2>3. Lines and Spaces</h2>
  <p>The lines and spaces of the staff are counted from bottom to top. For example, the 1st line is the bottom line, while the 5th line is the top line — and the same counting applies to spaces.</p>
